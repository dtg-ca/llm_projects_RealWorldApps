A bunch of apps that simulate real world use cases

This is a collection of apps that embody the basic functionality of real world use cases like:
1. Customer Support Chatbot
2. Virtual Personal Assistant
3. Medical Symptoms checker
4. Product Recommender

These can further be enhanced and take the form of productivity enhancement applications by adding agents and tools to the backend. 
Further enhancement by adding more features and functionalities through multi-agent set up and accordingly tweaking the frontend Web UI would result in fully functional commercial equivalents for these use cases.
